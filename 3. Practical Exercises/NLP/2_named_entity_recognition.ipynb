    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying entities within unstructured text into predefined categories such as names, organisations, location, dates, monetary values, and more. For example, in the sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Apple Inc. is planning to open a new office in San Francisco in March 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "NER should recognise 'Apple Inc.' as an organisation, 'San Francisco' as a location, and 'March 2025' as a date.\n",
    "\n",
    "NER is foundational for applications such as information extraction, search engines, document classification, chatbots, etc. It converts raw, unstructured text into structured data, making it easier for machines to understand, search, and analyse data in a natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of NER\n",
    "NER Models can be:\n",
    "- **Rule-based**: Use hand-crafted patterns and dictionaries.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning-based**: Use algorithms like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).\n",
    "- **Deep Learning-based**: Use neural network based models (BiLSTM-CRF, BERT, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Steps\n",
    "1. Text Input\n",
    "    - Raw text is provided as input.\n",
    "2. Text Preprocessing\n",
    "    - Tokenisation\n",
    "    - POS Tagging\n",
    "3. Feature Extraction\n",
    "    - Extracting features such as capitalisation, context, and known entity lists.\n",
    "4. Model Application\n",
    "    - Applying a trained model to classify tokens.\n",
    "5. Entity Classification\n",
    "    - Assigning labels to detected entities.\n",
    "6. Post-Prorcessing\n",
    "    - Refining results, handling ambiguities or nested entities.\n",
    "7. Output Generation\n",
    "    - Producing annotated or structured output."
