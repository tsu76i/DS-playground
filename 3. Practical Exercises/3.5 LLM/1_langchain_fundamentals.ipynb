The most common example is the `TextSplitter`, such as the `ResursiveCharacterTextSplitter` which splits documents based on character count, overlap, or other configurable criteria.\n",

    "Text splitters ensure that content is broken down into appropriate sized chunks that do not exceed the maximum token limit of LLMs, thereby generating more precise embeddings. This approach also facilitates parallel (batch) processing of document chunks. By setting the `chunk_overlap` parameter, splitters preserve context across adjacent chunks, reducing the loss of important information and improving retrieval accuracy in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.\n",

Similarity between texts is then measured using vector similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, inner product), which quantify the geometric closeness of their corresponding vectors.\n",
