    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "For developing modern applications powered by large language models (LLMs), the LangChain ecosystem is the most popular / best practice framework offering thorough simplification and robustness suitable for production-ready deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LangChain ecosystem comprises several key libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangChain** for core development of LLM-powered applications, providing abstractions, chains, and retrieval mechanisms.\n",
    "- **LangSmith** for monitoring, evaluating, and debugging LangChain applications.\n",
    "- **LangGraph** for orchestrating stateful, complex multi-agent workflows and building advanced AI pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project covers the fundamentals of LangChain through practical examples, referencing official tutorials and educational videos from YouTube as learning resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Environmental Variables\n",
    "Firstly, environmental variables need to be configured. These variables, especially API keys should never be hardcoded or made visible to others. The [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) libray makes it straightforward to securely access variables set in a `.env` file."

    "## 5. Sequential Chain\n",
    "A Sequential Chain is a chain that executes multiple steps (or sub-chains) in a defined order, where the output of one step becomes the input to the next. This allows us to build complex workflows by composing simpler chains sequentially. In the following example, the first chain takes the input `ingredient` and generates a `dish` that uses the ingredient. Then, the second chain takes the `dish` name as input and writes a `description` of the dish, returning the description as the final output."

    "Retrievers in LangChain are components responsible for fetching relevant information based on a query. They serve as an interface between the user's query and a data storage or search system (e.g., vector stores or external APIs). Retrievers are runnable components, meaning they support standard runnable operations such as `.invoke()` and `.batch()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By wrapping the `.similarity_search()` method with a function and adding the `@chain` decorator, the non-runnable similarity search method can be effectively transformed into a runnable retriever.\n",
    "Finally, the `.batch()` method allows querying multiple questions at once, making retrieval efficient for bulk queries or parallel processing."
