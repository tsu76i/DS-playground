    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "A Vanila Neural Network(VNN), also known as a feedforward neural network, is the most basic form of artificial neural network and serves as athe foundation for more advanced architectures. It is called *vanilla* because it lacks the additional features or complexities found in specialised neural networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layers\n",
    "A vanilla neural network is composed of one input layer, one or more hidden layer(s) and one output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Layer**: Receives the data input.\n",
    "- **Hidden Layer(s)**: Layer(s) where data is processed through weighted connections. These layers allow the network to learn complex patterns.\n",
    "- **Output Layer**: Procudes the final output (e.g., a class label or a predicted value).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neurons\n",
    "Each layer consists of units called **neurons**. Each neuron receives input, processes it, and passes the output to the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weights and Biases\n",
    "- Weights ($W$) determine the strength of connections between neurons\n",
    "- Biases ($b$) allow the model to shift the activation function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Functions\n",
    "Activation functions are non-linear functions that allow models to learn complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Loading Data\n",
    "The XOR dataset is a simple dataset based on the exclusive OR (XOR) logical operation. It involves two binary inputs (either 0 or 1) and one binary output. The output is $1$ if exactly one of the inputs is $1$, and $0$ otherwise. "
