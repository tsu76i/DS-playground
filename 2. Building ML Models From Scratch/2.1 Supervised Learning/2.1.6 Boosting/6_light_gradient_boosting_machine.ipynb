    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)** is a gradient boosting framework optimised for speed and scalability, making it highly suitable for regression and classification tasks involving large datasets. LightGBM uses **gradient-based one-sided sampling (GOSS)** and **exclusive feature bundling (EFB)** to speed up training and handle high-dimensional data efficiently. Traditional gradient boosting and XGBoost grow trees level-wise (depth-wise), whereas LightGBM grows trees leaf-wise. At each step, LightGBM splits the leaf with the largest loss reduction, which can lead to deeper, more complex trees and often higher accuracy, but also a higher risk of overfitting if not properly regularised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)** is an ensemble machine learning model that builds a strong predictive model by sequentially combining multiple weak models (typically decision trees) in a stage-wise manner. The core idea is to iteratively add new models that correct the errors made by the existing ensemble, thereby improving overall predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset ${(x_i, y_i)}^n_{i=1}$ where $x_i$ are the features and $y_i$ are the target values. The goal of gradient boosting is to find a function $F(x)$ that minimises a given differentiable loss function $L(y, F(x))$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    F(x) = F_0(x) + \\sum^{M}_{m=1}\\gamma_m h_m(x)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $F_0(x)$: Initial model (e.g., the mean of $y$).\n",
    "- $\\gamma_i$: Weight (step size) for the $m$-th weak learner, typically determined by minimising the loss function along the direction of $h_m(x)$.\n",
    "- $M$: Number of boosting iterations (e.g., the number of weak learners).\n",
    "- $h_m$: prediction from the $m$-th weak learner (e.g., a decision tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- The histogram-based approach and leaf-wise growth strategy make LightGBM significantly faster and more memory-efficient, especially on large datasets.\n",
    "- The leaf-wise spliting often leads to better accuracy, as it focuses on reducing the largest errors at each iteration.\n",
    "- Efficient binning and feature bundling reduce memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- Overgitting risk due to the leaf-wise tree growth.\n",
    "- Sensitive to hypermarameters (e.g., learning rate, number of leaves, regularisation parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Initialise the model:\n",
    "    - Start with a simple model, typically a constant value:\n",
    "        - For regression: the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "        - For binary classification: the log-odds of the positive classes.\n",
    "1. Calculate residuals (Negative Gradients) and Hessian:\n",
    "    - For each iteration, compute the the negative gradients (and Hessian for second-order methods) of the loss function with respect to the current predictions.\n",
    "1. Fit a new weak model to predict the residuals:\n",
    "    - Train a weak learner (decision tree) to predict the rediduals.\n",
    "    - LightGBM grows the tree by splitting the leaf with the largest loss reduction (max delta loss), rather than level-wise as in traditional boosting.\n",
    "1. Update the model:\n",
    "    - Add the predictions from the new weak learners to the current model's predictions, scaled by a learning rate (shrinkage parameter).\n",
    "    - The update corrects the errors made by the current ensemble\n",
    "1. Repeat steps 2-4 for a pre-defined number of iterations.\n",
    "1. Final prediction:\n",
    "    - The sum of the initial prediction and the scaled outputs of all weak learners forms the final model."
