    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "**Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** is an advanced implementation of the gradient boosting framework, specifically designed for speed, efficiency, and scalability in supervise machine learning tasks such as classification and regression. It is particularly renowed for its performance on structured (tabular) data and has become a standard tool in data science competitions (e.g., Kaggle) and industry applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost is based on **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**, which is an ensemble machine learning model that builds a strong predictive model by sequentially combining multiple weak models (typically decision trees) in a stage-wise manner. The core idea is to iteratively add new models that correct the errors made by the existing ensemble, thereby improving overall predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset ${(x_i, y_i)}^n_{i=1}$ where $x_i$ are the features and $y_i$ are the target values. The goal of XGBoost is to find a function $F(x)$ that minimises a given regularised objective function $L$:\n",

    "\\begin{align*}\n",

    "- $F_0(x)$: Initial model (e.g., the mean of $y$).\n",
    "- $\\eta$: Learning rate.\n",
    "- $M$: Number of boosting iterations (e.g., the number of weak learners).\n",
    "- $h_m$: prediction from the $m$-th weak learner (e.g., a decision tree).\n",
    "\n",

    "And the regularised objective function to be minimised:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Differences: Gradient Boosting vs. XGBoost\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting fits trees to the negative gradient (residuals) of the loss function, typically using only first-order derivatives and mean values at leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- XGBoost uses both first and second derivatives (gradient and Hessian), incorporates regularisation, and computes optimal leaf weights analytically. It also uses a more sophisticated split criterion (gain) and regularisation to control overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- XGBoost adds L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularisation to the loss function, which helps prevent overfitting and improves overall model performance.\n",
    "- Rather than stopping splits when no further gain is achieved, XGBoost grows trees to a maximum depth and then prunes them backward, removing splits with negative gain (depth-first approach).\n",
    "- Natively handles missing values by learning the optimal direction to take when a value is missing.\n",
    "- Supports parallel tree construction and distributed computation, making it much faster than traditional gradient boosting implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- Memory usage can be high with large datasets.\n",
    "- Not ideal for text or images. XGBoost is suited for tabular data than unstructured inputs.\n",
    "- Sensitive to hypermarameters (e.g., learning rate, number of trees, regularisation parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Initialise the model:\n",
    "    - Start with a simple model, typically a constant value:\n",
    "        - For regression: the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "        - For binary classification: the log-odds of the positive classes.\n",
    "1. Calculate residuals (Negative Gradients) and Hessian:\n",
    "    - For each iteration, compute the the negative gradients (and Hessian for second-order methods) of the loss function  with respect to the current predictions.\n",
    "1. Fit a new weak model to predict the residuals:\n",
    "    - Train a weak learner (typically a shallow decision tree) to predict the rediduals.\n",
    "    - The weak learner focuses on correcting the errors made by the current ensemble.\n",
    "1. Update the model:\n",
    "    - Add the predictions from the new weak learners to the current model's predictions, scaled by a learning rate (shrinkage parameter).\n",
    "    - This update moves the ensemble closer to the true values by correcting previous errors.\n",
    "1. Repeat steps 2-4 for a pre-defined number of iterations.\n",
    "1. Final prediction:\n",
    "    - The sum of the initial prediction and the scaled outputs of all weak learners.\n"
